# alexagide.github.io
A Coromon Wiki to replace the old fandom one to avoid being restricted to the webpage structure.
I also need some help, you can DM me through Discord (Alexagide#5171) to help me out!
<p>06/06/21: I've created and updated link to traits pages, it's just for later to avoid frorgeting!</p>
<p>06/01/21: End of the break. I've done all coromon types pages (except the one's exclusive to skills, wip).<br>
  I didn't check if all links work properly.</p>
